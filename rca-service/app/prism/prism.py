"""PRISM: Graph-Free Root Cause Analysis (Pham, arXiv:2601.21359).

Vendored verbatim from `ArthurrMrv/automated_root_cause_analysis` (`RCAEval/e2e/prism.py`), with
exactly one line changed: `preprocess` is imported from the local `time_series` module instead of
`RCAEval.io.time_series`, so this package runs on numpy and pandas alone. Keep it diffable — fix
PRISM upstream and re-copy the file rather than editing it here (see docs/verified.md).

PRISM ranks root cause candidates without a dependency graph. Under the paper's
Component-Property Model, every component exposes *internal* properties (local
resource state: cpu, memory, disk I/O, socket count) and *external* properties
(boundary-observable QoS: latency, error rate, request rate). Axioms 2.5-2.6 say
faults originate internally and propagate between components only externally, so
the root cause is the component anomalous in *both* classes, while downstream
components are anomalous only externally -- even when their external anomaly is
the larger one.

Pipeline (Figure 2): deviation-based anomaly scoring (Sec 3.1) -> pooling of
property scores into per-component S^I and S^E (Sec 3.2) -> root cause scoring
and ranking (Sec 3.3). Default configuration is zscore + max + additive, per the
footnote of Table 5.

The paper ships no reference implementation; every value it left unspecified is
marked `# gap N:` below and tabulated in the reproduction notes.

v2 keeps every specified part of the paper identical to `prism.py` and only
revisits the gaps that were distorting the ranking rather than filling it:
the zero-scale fallback (gap 5) no longer scores a property in raw units and
never lets epsilon stand in for a scale,
preprocessing runs once over the whole frame instead of once per window, and
pooling is NaN-safe. `diagnostics` in the returned dict reports how often each
of those fired, per case.
